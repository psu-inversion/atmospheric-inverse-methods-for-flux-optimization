Welcome to Inversion's documentation!
======================================

This package contains functions and classes developed for the
application of inverse methods to the optimization of carbon dioxide
surface fluxes using atmospheric mixing ratio measurements.
Derivations of the equations and terminology are given in :ref:`the
section on the theory <theory>`.  The :ref:`User Guide <user_guide>`
walks through an example of using the code.
